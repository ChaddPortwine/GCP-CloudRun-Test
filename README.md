# GCP Cloud Run Test
This project (when completed) has the code and configuration to containerize an express server that can be deployed to Google's Cloud Run service.

## Docker Hub & Google Cloud Run
### No Google SDK
It is possible to use `gcloud` commands to build and deploy a container to a GCP project instead of Docker Hub. However, for this project a goal is to use Docker Hub in the CI/CD pipeline.
